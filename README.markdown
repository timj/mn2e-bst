-------

This style file was originally written by John Sleath and Tim Jenness
at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in the summer of 1995. It
was derived from the `astron.bst` style file which itself was derived
from the `apalike.bst` style file.

Norman Gray provided the multi-author style fixes.
