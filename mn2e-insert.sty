% Meta remarks:
%
% The following definitions are to be emitted within the
% {thebibliography} environment in the generated .bbl file.
% That is, (contrary to appearances) this file is _not_ expected to be
% imported using \usepackage, and it is laid out as such merely for convenience.
%
% The contents of this file should be edited in this file, then
% processed to add a 'write$ newline$' on each line, and then inserted
% into the mn2e.bst file's {begin.bib} function.  This can be done
% either by hand or using the minify.sed script in the distribution
%('make mn2e-insert.txt').
%
% The code below inserts whitespace whereever
% feasible.  This is because the processing of this file can create
% rather long lines, and bibtex's output line-breaking can mangle
% these badly if there aren't plenty of spaces to help it (we don't
% want linebreaks inside command-sequences!).
%
%
% More LaTeX-ish remarks:
%
% The definitions below depend on the presence of a \href{URL}{text}
% macro, as provided by the hyperref package.  The mn2e.bst style
% depends additionally on the \url{URL} macro, which hyperref also provides.
%
% If the hyperref package is not included, then suitable defaults are
%
%   \def\href#1#2{#2}
%   \def\@url#1{#1\endgroup}
%   \def\url{\begingroup\@urlcharsother \ttfamily \@url}
%
% These must appear _instead_ of loading the hyperref package
% (it'll probably be OK to let the hyperref package redefine these,
% but that is to tempt fate).

% \mn@urlcharsother
%
% 'Other' some characters which may appear in DOIs and URIs.
%
% All of the characters here may appear in URIs, except for '^'.
%
% There appear to be almost no restrictions on what characters appear
% in DOIs (or at least none discovereable in ISO 26324:2012, which
% says simply that the 'DOI suffix' is "a character string of any
% length".  A DOI registrant which uses characters outside alphanumeric plus
% the following set, is a DOI registrant who should be taken outside
% and vigorously challenged on their taste.
%
% The following list is not simply \dospecials, because that includes
% '\', '{' and '}', which we need.  And if they're in a DOI... well.

% \mn@doi{10.foo} formats the DOI in the argument, and provides a link to dx.doi.org.

% The DOI can contain {\$&#^_%~} (though there's not necessarily a
